What is a stack? How can a list be used to implement it?
- A stack is a set of functions or libraries used to unify the code. A list can help define functions within that stack
let mypets = ... each line
- mypets[1] = "dog" | mypets[3] = not in range
write code to
- names = ["bla", "bla2", "bla3"]
- names.insert(1, "bla4")
- names.pop()

Corrections:
A stack is a collection of objects that supports fast last-in, first-out (LIFO) semantics for inserts and deletes. Unlike lists or arrays, stacks typically donâ€™t allow for random access to the objects they contain. The insert and delete operations are also often called push and pop.
